The official course has hold the latest course slides, but without the video resources for CS106L, so I watched the videos on the Youtube.

## Programming Assignments

Since one of the 2019 CS106L assignment is to implement WikiRacer, which requires a more complicated QT environment to be configured, I completed the latest 2023 assignment instead.

There are two programming assignments to help you practice what you have learned in class.

- [SimpleEnroll](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/assignments/Assignment1_SimpleEnroll.pdf) : You will use stream o figure out which CS classes on ExploreCourses are offered this year.You’ll be taking advantage of streams, while also exercising initialization and references in C++

- [Marriage Pact](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/assignments/Assignment2_MarriagePact.pdf) :  Get all applicants and find matchs! In this part, you can practice to get you started working with the STL’s containers and pointers.
